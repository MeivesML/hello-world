Exploration of Git and Github

My primary passion is "To enable others to achieve their desired best."

I have worked in the manufacturing field for 15 years and am pondering a change in careers.
Early on, I enjoyed exploring the very basic programming classes.  Within my career, I have always had and expressed a passion for automating activities via electronic means be it utilizing the functionality of common programs or diving in and reverse engineering currently running programs to augment them.

I am excited to explore the potentials in Github to gain more knowledge in my areas of programming interest.
